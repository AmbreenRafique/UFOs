# UFOs

## Overview of Project:
The purpose of the project is to help a data journalist "Dana" to create a table to organize UFO data. Who has to write about her hometown McMinnville which is famous for UFO sightings.
Gathering all the UFO information and putting it into a table makes it easy to filter the required information. 


## Results:
The webpage looks good and user-friendly.
By putting all UFO sighting data in a table with multiple filter buttons has made it easy to read and analyse the information.

Visitors can filter data by entering particular date or place even they will be able to sort by the shape of UFO. Following picture shows the look of the webpage and all the available filters.

Analysing the data and creating a report has become easier by puting all the information on a page. If we enter a state it will show all the sightings of that particuler state as shown in the picture below.

## Summary:
There should be a place/button to take user's input in case of a new sighting or any other information if someone would like to share.
A comment/review button will also make it a better website to visit.
